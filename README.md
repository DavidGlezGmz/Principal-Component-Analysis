# Principal-Component-Analysis

In statistics, principal components analysis (PCA) is a technique used to describe a data set in terms of new uncorrelated variables (“components”). Components are ordered by the amount of original variance they describe, so the technique is useful for reducing the dimensionality of a data set.

Technically, PCA looks for the projection according to which the data is best represented in terms of least squares. This converts a set of possibly correlated variable observations into a set of linearly uncorrelated variable values called principal components.

PCA is primarily used for exploratory data analysis and to build predictive models. PCA involves computing the eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix, typically after centering the data on the mean of each attribute.
